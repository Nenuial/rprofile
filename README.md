This package

## Notes

  - The `lsos()` function was taken from the
    [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1358003/203420) question.

  - The improved version of  was adapted from the
    [autoinst](https://github.com/jimhester/autoinst/). I did think
    about importing the package, but I had made too many personal
    tweaks.

  - Setting the prompt uses the excellent
    [prompt](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/prompt) package.
